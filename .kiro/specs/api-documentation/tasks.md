# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Audit and enhance rustdoc documentation for existing APIs
  - Scan all public APIs in `src/api/`, `src/core/`, and `src/middleware/` modules for missing documentation
  - Add comprehensive rustdoc comments with descriptions, parameters, return types, and error conditions
  - Include practical code examples using `#[doc]` attributes for complex functions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Expand OpenAPI documentation coverage in docs.rs
  - Add all missing API endpoints to the OpenAPI schema (user endpoints, health endpoints, refresh token endpoints)
  - Include all request/response schemas and error response types in the components section
  - Add comprehensive API metadata including title, description, contact information, and server configurations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create comprehensive code examples directory structure
  - Create `examples/` directory with subdirectories for authentication, user management, and integration workflows
  - Implement practical code examples showing complete authentication flows, user CRUD operations, and error handling patterns
  - Write examples that demonstrate kitchen management workflows and common API usage patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Enhance OpenAPI schema with kitchen management context
  - Add kitchen management-specific tags and descriptions to organize endpoints logically
  - Include security scheme documentation for JWT bearer authentication
  - Add rate limiting information and workflow context using OpenAPI extensions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [-] 5. Implement documentation validation and testing framework
  - Create test suite to validate that all public APIs have proper documentation
  - Add tests to ensure OpenAPI specification is valid and complete
  - Implement example validation tests that verify code examples compile and execute correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Integrate documentation generation into build process
  - Enhance `build.rs` to include documentation generation and validation steps
  - Add documentation completeness checks that prevent builds with missing documentation
  - Create automated OpenAPI specification validation during build process
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Set up documentation deployment and accessibility
  - Ensure Swagger UI is properly configured and accessible at `/swagger-ui` endpoint
  - Verify OpenAPI specification is served correctly at `/api-docs/openapi.json`
  - Test documentation accessibility and interactive functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_
