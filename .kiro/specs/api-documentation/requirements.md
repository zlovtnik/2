# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add comprehensive inline documentation for all public APIs in the kitchen management system. The goal is to provide developers with clear, comprehensive documentation that includes examples, OpenAPI/Swagger generation, and code samples for common use cases. This will improve developer experience, reduce onboarding time, and ensure consistent API usage across the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the kitchen management API, I want comprehensive inline documentation for all public functions and endpoints, so that I can understand how to use the API without reading source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views any public API function THEN the system SHALL provide rustdoc comments with clear descriptions
2. WHEN a developer accesses API documentation THEN the system SHALL include parameter descriptions, return types, and error conditions
3. WHEN a developer needs usage examples THEN the system SHALL provide code examples for common use cases
4. IF a function has complex behavior THEN the system SHALL include detailed examples using `#[doc]` attributes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer or API consumer, I want automatically generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, so that I can understand available endpoints, request/response schemas, and test the API interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds THEN it SHALL automatically generate OpenAPI 3.0 specification
2. WHEN a developer accesses the API documentation endpoint THEN the system SHALL serve interactive Swagger UI
3. WHEN API schemas change THEN the OpenAPI documentation SHALL automatically update
4. WHEN a developer views endpoint documentation THEN it SHALL include request/response examples, status codes, and error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new team member or external developer, I want practical code examples and usage patterns, so that I can quickly understand how to implement common kitchen management workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to implement authentication THEN the system SHALL provide complete code examples
2. WHEN a developer wants to manage menu items THEN the system SHALL include CRUD operation examples
3. WHEN a developer needs to handle orders THEN the system SHALL provide order workflow examples
4. WHEN a developer integrates real-time features THEN the system SHALL include WebSocket usage examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator or DevOps engineer, I want documentation build processes integrated into the development workflow, so that documentation stays current and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the documentation build process SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN documentation builds fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment
3. WHEN documentation is generated THEN it SHALL be accessible via a dedicated endpoint
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN the documentation SHALL reflect those changes immediately
